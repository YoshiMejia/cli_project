# cli_project

This program is perfect for anyone like me who can't use certain cosmetics due to their ingredients!

The program gives you access to tons of lipstick brands and helps you refine your search according to certain special-ingredients such as Vegan lipstick, or Non-GMO lipsticks. Or, if you already have a favorite brand, you can select to refine your search by the brands offered to you by the program. Lastly, you can also choose to see the complete list of lipsticks from the program site, but beware! The full list is about 125+ lipsticks so you will be given a list of 25 lipsticks first, and then you can decide to see the full list.

No matter what you decide, you will be provided the Brand name, Price, as well as it's description.
